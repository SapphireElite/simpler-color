Create your own **complete Web color system** fast and easy, from **as little as one base color**!

Color is at the heart of every UI design system. A cohesive color system enables your application to:

- **consistently** express brand identity and style
- **effectively** communicate intent and meaning

Simpler Color makes it super easy to implement your own CSS-compliant color system for any JavaScript/TypeScript project, no matter what platform, framework, or UI library you are using. It works in the browser, server (Node), mobile (React Native) and desktop (Electron).

## Easy as 1-2-3!

**Step 1:** Install simpler-color

```
npm install simpler-color
```

**Step 2:** Define your color palettes and their corresponding base colors

```js
const baseColors = {
  primary: '#609E3F',
  secondary: '#5D745D',
  neutral: '#5E5F5A',
  ...etc,
}
```

**‚ÄîOR‚Äî** just give simpler-color ONE base color, and it will generate the rest!

```js
import { harmony } from 'simpler-color'

// Generate 5 harmonious base colors from your main brand color!
const baseColors = harmony('#609E3F')
```

**Step 3:** Create your color scheme(s) by mapping UI roles to specific colors from your palettes

```js
import { colorScheme } from 'simpler-color'

const uiColors = colorScheme(baseColors, colors => ({
  primaryButton: colors.primary(40),
  primaryButtonText: colors.primary(95),
  surface: colors.neutral(98),
  text: colors.neutral(10),
  ...etc,
}))

// Access various UI colors as `uiColors.primaryButton` and so on.
```

If some of those terms sound alien to you, read on...

## Key Concepts

We're not gonna discuss Color Theory here, but let's talk a bit about what a proper color system comprises.

### Color Palette

Creating your color system begins with building your _color palettes_. Each palette consists of a group of related colors, generated from one _base color_.

You decide what sort of relationship should be between colors in the palette. The most common type is the _tonal palette_ (also called _monochromatic_), which is made up of various "tones" of the same general hue. For example, various shades of green is a tonal palette.

Each color in a palette is accessed by a unique _color key_, which is a string or number that indicates its relationship with the base color. The color values are determined by a _color mapping function_, which returns a specific color value for a given color key.

Palettes are automatically created by simpler-color based on your specified base colors. By default, it generates **tonal** palettes, with specific tones accessed by passing a numeric key between 0 and 100, which represents % _lightness_ (0 = black, 100 = white). Any value in between generates a specific shade of the base color. So, for example, if your `primary` palette is based on green (like in the illustration above), `primary(40)` gives you green with 40% lightness.

You can, of course, define your own color mapping function to override the default. This also means that you can define a completely different set of color keys, which can be any of these common alternatives:

- string values, e.g. 'darker', 'dark', 'base', 'light', 'lighter'
- discrete numeric values, e.g. 0, 10, 20, ..., 90, 95, 98, 100 (like Material Design 3 does)

### Color Set

The _color set_ is simply the collective term for all the color palettes built.

Typically a color set would have a _primary_ palette. This represents the main "brand" color of your app. This is the most prominent hue across your UI.

Common additional palettes can be any of (but not limited to) these:

- _secondary_: less prominent, usually more muted
- _accent_: usually complementary (opposite) to primary, to provide contrast
- _neutral_: typically shades of gray or similar neutral tones

To ensure consistency of your color set, simpler-color enforces that you use the same set of color keys (and thus the same color mapping function) across all your palettes.

### Color Scheme

A color system consists of one or several _color schemes_. These days, it's quite common to implement both Light and Dark color schemes. You can also choose to add some High Contrast schemes for accessibility.

To create a color scheme, you first identify the various _UI roles_ in your design system. Each role indicates a specific use or purpose of color as it applies to specific elements of the UI.

Some common examples of UI role:

- primary button
- primary button text
- surface/background color
- text color

The final step is to map each UI role to a specific color value from one of the palettes in your color set. Each such mapping gives us one color scheme. By using a consistent set of color roles, simpler-color helps ensure that your UI can easily and safely switch between color schemes.

## Recipes

### Defining a custom color mapping function

```js
import { complement, saturation } from 'simpler-color'

function awesomeColor(baseColor, key) {
  return complement(saturation(baseColor, 80), key)
}

const uiColors = colorScheme(
  'blue',
  colors => ({
    primaryButton: colors.primary(0),
    floatingActionButton: colors.primary(2),
    ...etc,
  }),
  {
    colorMapping: awesomeColor, // üëà
  },
)
```
